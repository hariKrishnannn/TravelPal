# TravelPal – Learning Notes

These are my personal notes while building the TravelPal project.  
They summarize what I learned, issues faced, and improvements I plan to add.  

## 📌 What I Learned
- Setting up an Express.js server with `dotenv` and `nodemon`.
- Using `app.use()` to mount routers for modular route handling.
- Creating modular routes with `express.Router()` for destinations.
- Implementing controllers to separate business logic from routes.
- Understanding basic CRUD operations for API endpoints.
- Sending JSON responses with `res.status().json()`.

## 🛠️ Challenges I Faced
- Configuring `cross-env` for different environments on Windows.
- Managing route conflicts and keeping project structure clean.
